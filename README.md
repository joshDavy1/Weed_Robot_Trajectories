# Weed_Robot_Trajectories

## TODO
- Add Joint limits to trajectoryGenerator (With IK) in order to generate fastest feasible movements
    - As part of this move parabolic trajectory from cartesian space to joint space
- Form planner which takes weed pose, chooses a interception point, and returns trajectory (or states that it unfeasible to spray)
- Form higher level descion making based on generated times
- Incoropoate descions on velocity (Somehow?)
